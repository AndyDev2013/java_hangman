A small program I wrote to learn a little about string manipulation in first year

#Installation Notes

This is a small java program. So to run it you need java installed
and have set up the enviroment variable.

* Compile it on the command line [Command Line tutorial](http://www.instructables.com/id/Programing-with-Java-using-Command-Prompt/)
* Use and IDE like eclipse [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
* Use a simplier IDE like TextPad [TextPad](https://www.textpad.com/)
